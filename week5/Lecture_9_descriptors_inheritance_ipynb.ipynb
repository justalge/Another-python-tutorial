        "Descriptors were introduced to Python in version 2.2. That time the \"What's New in Python2.2\" mentioned: \"The one big idea underlying the new class model is that an API for describing the attributes of an object using descriptors has been formalized. Descriptors specify the value of an attribute, stating whether itâ€™s a method or a field. With the descriptor API, static methods and class methods become possible, as well as more exotic constructs.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "**A descriptor is an object attribute with \"binding behavior\", one whose attribute access has been overridden by methods in the descriptor protocol. Those methods are \\_\\_get__(),  \\_\\_set__(), and \\_\\_delete__()**\n",
        "\n",
        "If any of those methods are defined for an object, it is said to be a descriptor.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let a closer look at what is happening. Assuming we have an object obj: What happens if we try to access an attribute (or property) ap? \"Accesssing\" the attribute means to \"get\" the value, so the attribute is used for example in a print function or inside of an expression. Both the obj and the class belong to type(obj) contain a dictionary attribute __dict__. This situation is viuslaized in the following diagram:\n",

        "No object-oriented programming language would be worthy to look at or use, if it didn't support inheritance. Inheritance was invented in 1969 for Simula. Python not only supports inheritance but multiple inheritance as well. Generally speaking, inheritance is the mechanism of deriving new classes from existing ones. By doing this, we get a hierarchy of classes. In most class-based object-oriented languages, an object created through inheritance (a \"child object\") acquires all, - though there are exceptions in some programming languages, - of the properties and behaviors of the parent object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance allows programmers to create classes that are built upon existing classes, and this enables a class created through inheritance to inherit the attributes and methods of the parent class. This means that inheritance supports code reusability. The methods or generally speaking the software inherited by a subclass is considered to be reused in the subclass. The relationships of objects or classes through inheritance give rise to a directed graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "The class from which a class inherits is called the parent or superclass. A class which inherits from a superclass is called a subclass, also called heir class or child class. Superclasses are sometimes called ancestors as well. There exists a hierarchical relationship between classes. It's similar to relationships or categorizations that we know from real life. Think about vehicles, for example. Bikes, cars, buses and trucks are vehicles. Pick-ups, vans, sports cars, convertibles and estate cars are all cars and by being cars they are vehicles as well. We could implement a vehicle class in Python, which might have methods like accelerate and brake. Cars, Buses and Trucks and Bikes can be implemented as subclasses which will inherit these methods from vehicle.\n",

Inheriting these methods means that we can use them as if they were defined in the PhysicianRobot class.

They are the methods with this clumsy syntax, i.e. the double underscores at the beginning and the end. They are also hard to talk about. How do you pronounce or say a method name like \\_\\_init__? \"Underscore underscore init underscore underscore\" sounds horrible and is almost a tongue twister. \"Double underscore init double underscore\" is a lot better, but the ideal way is \"dunder init dunder\" That's why magic methods methods are sometimes called dunder methods!\n",
